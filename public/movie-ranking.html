<h1> The Best Movies According to Celeste </h1>

<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time </h2>

<hr />

<h3> Transformers One </h3>
<p> Fun movie that gives more background to Optimus and Megatron's relationship. </p>

<h3> Sonic 3 </h3>
<p> I mean Jim Carrey is always going to make a movie great, so TWO Jim Carrey's? I'm sat. </p>

<h3> Nosferatu (2024) </h3>
<p> Thrilling and terrifying, Nosferatu is a movie about giving in to our darker side. OoOOoh. </p>
